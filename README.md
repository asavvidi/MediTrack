# MediTrack üè•

MediTrack is a medical record management system that allows users to manage patient profiles and their corresponding medical history. It's designed as a RESTful API using Spring Boot and can be used with frontend applications or testing tools like Postman.

## Overview

MediTrack lets users perform CRUD operations on patients and medical records, associate records with specific patients, and handle data with meaningful error messages. It is built with:

- **Spring Boot** for the backend
- **Spring Data JPA** for ORM and database interaction
- **Postgresql** as the database 


## Features

- **Add & Manage Patients:** Create, update, fetch, or delete patient profiles.
- **Medical Records Management:** Assign and maintain medical records for patients.
- **Relational Mapping:** Each medical record is linked to a patient using JPA.
- **Exception Handling:** Custom exceptions like `PatientNotFoundException` and `MedicalRecordNotFoundException` for better error feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)**
